# myNextCity
This is a project I am currently working on. I am developing a website to help users find the best city for them by having them input their preferences in a city, like weather, urbanism, cost of living, etc. I am utilizing FastAPI to build out the backend logic, PostgreSQL for data storage, and Next.js for front-end development.
